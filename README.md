# Advance E‑commerce Website (Frontend)

A single-page React frontend for a full-featured e-commerce platform. It provides a customer-facing storefront (product listing, search, filters, cart, checkout) and an admin dashboard (manage users/products/orders, analytics, and real-time chat).

## About

This project is a Vite + React application implementing a modern e-commerce UI with Redux for state management and Socket.IO for real-time chat. It integrates PayPal for payments and Recharts for analytics visualizations. Routes include public product listing and product details, protected user pages (profile, orders), and protected admin pages (users, products, orders, chats, analytics).

## Tech stack

- React 18 + Vite
- Redux (+ thunk) for state management
- React Router v6 for routing
- Bootstrap / react-bootstrap for UI
- Axios for HTTP requests
- socket.io-client for realtime chat
- @paypal/paypal-js for PayPal checkout
- Recharts for charts / analytics

## Key features

- Product browsing with pagination, categories and search filters
- Product detail view with image zoom and ratings
- Cart management and checkout (PayPal integration present)
- User account area: profile, order history, order details
- Admin dashboard: manage users, products, orders, view analytics, and chat
- Real-time chat between users and admins using Socket.IO

## Quick start (development)

Requirements: Node.js 18.x (project `package.json` lists `18.15.0`).

Run these commands in PowerShell from the project root:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL Vite reports (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Build for production:

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Environment / Backend notes

The frontend currently references the backend at `https://topazio-shop-backend.onrender.com` (used for API requests and Socket.IO connections). For local development, it's strongly recommended to use Vite environment variables instead of hardcoded URLs.

Suggested variables to add to a `.env` file at the project root:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://topazio-shop-backend.onrender.com
VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://topazio-shop-backend.onrender.com
VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID
```

Notes:
- Vite exposes variables prefixed with `VITE_` to the client code. After changing `.env` you must restart the dev server.
- Files where the backend/socket URL is currently hardcoded and may need updating:
  - `src/components/HeaderComponent.jsx`
  - `src/components/user/UserChatComponent.jsx`
  - `src/pages/admin/components/AnalyticsPageComponent.jsx`
- PayPal: the repo includes PayPal integration points. Depending on the integration style you may need to supply a client ID in `VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` or implement server-side order creation on the backend.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start development server
- `npm run build` — build production bundle
- `npm run preview` — preview production build
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint on `src` (project includes ESLint config and plugins)

## Where to edit copy & content

- Customer-facing pages and components: `src/pages/` and `src/components/`
- Admin pages and admin-specific components: `src/pages/admin/` and `src/pages/admin/components/`
- Redux logic (actions/reducers): `src/redux/`

## Contributing

1. Fork and create a feature branch.
2. Install dependencies and run the dev server.
3. Keep backend endpoints configurable via environment variables.
4. Run `npm run lint` and keep code style consistent.

If you want, I can also:

- Convert the few hardcoded backend URLs to use `VITE_API_URL` and `VITE_SOCKET_URL`.
- Add a short `CONTRIBUTING.md` with development guidelines.
- Provide a one-paragraph marketing blurb for a marketplace listing or README header.

Generated by a project analysis — let me know what tone and length you prefer for the README (short vs. detailed) and whether to replace hardcoded backend URLs automatically.
